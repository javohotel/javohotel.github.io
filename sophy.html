		<p>Hi! This is my top 10 episode of the Simpsons, made especially for my friend Sophia. She is a great friend whom I love very much, she is born and raised in the USA, lives in Los Angeles CA and travels every day to Providencia, Santiago, Chile to go to work ... It is for this reason that everything is in English (translated by Google).</p>

		<p>Sophy, I did not choose the episodes, just look for a top 10 and modify something, since choosing 10 chapters would be impossible. There are many!!.

		<p>All episodes will have a summary and a comment from me (in taco language) since that is my native language.</p>
